# Capturing Full Vehicle History

## Introduction
Capturing the full history of a vehicle involves recording all relevant details throughout its life-
cycle, including ownership, maintenance, accidents, inspections, repairs, and modifications. This
information provides transparency and helps potential buyers, insurance companies, and regu-
latory authorities verify the vehicleâ€™s condition, ensuring its safety, legal compliance, and resale
value.
